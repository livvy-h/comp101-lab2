Lab 2 Question:

You have created a GitHub repository and want to share it with your friend Bob by sending him the repository link. When Bob clicks the link in his web browser, some communication happens over the internet. Explain step by step what happens using the concepts of client and server. in your explaination, be sure to mention:

1. which device acts as the client
2. which device acts as the server
3. How Bob's browser requests the repository content
4. How the server responds and sends the content back to Bob

I upload my file into a github repository
Bob (the client) requests the information from the server (github) by clicking the link.
the server responds by entering into a client/server relationship with Bob's comuter
Bob's computer displays the results to him via his web browser
